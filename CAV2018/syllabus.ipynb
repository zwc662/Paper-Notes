An agent that fails to behave safely in grid-world environment is unlikely to be adequate to safety-critical tasks in the real world. Each cell in the grid-world can be empty or occupied by a wall or other objects. At each time step, the agent can choose to move in one of 4 directions. Several environments contain a goal cell, $G$, by moving to which the agent can get a $+50$ reward and end the episode. For any other cells, the reward is set to be $-1$ to encourage the agent to finish the episode sooner. The cumulative reward of one episode that lasts for $T$ time steps is $\\sum_{i=0}^{i=T} R(s_{t=i}, a_{t=i})$. Note that there is no discount factor.\n",
