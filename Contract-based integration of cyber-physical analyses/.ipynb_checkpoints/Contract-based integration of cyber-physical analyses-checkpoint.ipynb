    "<h2>Motivation</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Industrial CPS is heavily driven by models and analyses. \n",
    "* Modelling enables CPSs to be developed, upgraded, integrated, verified collaboratively before manufacturing.\n",
    "* Analyses guarantees important quality attributes for model creation and verification at design time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyses focusing on different CPS abstractions leads to expensive problems\n",
    "* one analyses modifies a system model in a way that violates the assumptions made by another\n",
    "* specification and verification techniques are designed and chosen by humans and hence limited by human cognition\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Example: Reconnaissance Aircraft</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread scheduling policies, CPU frequencies, battery cell scheduling policies and threads allocation are adjustable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the aircraft is controlled by a set of threads with different security levels executing on several processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* each thread executes an infinite sequence of periodic jobs. Each job is a finite computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* dynamical multicell batterry system with configurable connections between cells allows some cells discharging while others recharging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements:\n",
    "* data security – threads with different security levels should not run on the same CPU; \n",
    "* schedulability – all jobs must meet deadlines required by the control algorithms; \n",
    "* energy efficiency – CPUs must operate on the minimal frequency possible, thus maximizing battery life; \n",
    "* safe concurrency – threads must be free of deadlocks and race conditions; \n",
    "* thermal safety – even if a battery cell overheats, it should not trigger a chain reaction called thermal runaway \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions made for analyses on one item may conflict with that of another item.\n",
    "* running bin packing before thread allocation could violate secure co-location constraints set by the latter\n",
    "* using the frequency scaling algorithm that assumes a deadline-monotonic scheduler on a CPU that whereas uses the earliest-deadline-first scheduler\n",
