    "`Relational Inductive Biases` is used to achieve **`relational reasoning`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **`Relational reasoning`** manipulates `structured computation and representations` of `entities` and `relations`, using `rules` for how they can be composed.\n",
    "    * `Structure` is the product of composing a set of known building blocks. \n",
    "    * `Structured representations` capture the composition.\n",
    "    * `Structured computations` operate over the elements and their composition as a whole.\n",
    "    * `entity` is an element with attributes, e.g. mass, size, ...\n",
    "    * `relation` is a property between entities, e.g. same size, distance from, slower, ...\n",
    "    * `rule` is a function maps entities and relations to other entities and relations, e.g. 'does entity X has property Y?', 'do entity X and Y have property Z?', ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **`Inductive biases`** allows a learning algorithm to impose constraints on relationships and interactions between entities and prioritize one solution (or interpretation) over another, independent of the observed data.\n",
    "    * Examples include prior distribution in Bayesian model, regularization term penalizing overfitting, ...\n",
    "    * The underlying assumtion is that searching for good solutions is easier when there is less ambiguity among solutions, e.g. the problem can be interpreted with a linear model; the model errors to be minizied can be approximated by a quadratic penalty; the natural and residual errors can be described as Gaussian noise, ...\n",
    "     \n",
    "> * The composition of layers in standard neural networks provides certain particular type of relational inductive biases.\n",
    "    * For `MLP`, the dot product units are the `entities`; the fully connection between layers reflects `relations`; the `weights and biases` specify the `rules`.\n",
    "    * For `CNN`, the individual pixels are `entities`; the local receptive fields of the input reflects `relations`; the reuse of the relations between the localities across the input reflects `translation invariance`.\n",
    "    * For `RNN`, the hidden state of at each processing step is an `entity`; the Markov dependence of the hidden state on the hidden state of previous step and current input is the `relation`; the `rule` is that the hidden state is updated based on the current hidden state and current input; the reuse of the rule over each step reflects `temporal invariance`.\n",
    "* But there is no deep learning model working on arbitrary relational structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is needed is a model that have **explicit representations of entities and relations**, and **learning algorithms** that **find rules** so that the interaction of entities and relations can be realized. **Invariance** to `ordering` should be reflected. \n",
    "    * `ordering`: the relations between entities with certain same class, e.g. sizes, masses, ages, ...\n",

    "     * Compute the center of mass for a solar system with $n$ planetes with MLP from the input vector $[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]^T$ \n",
    "     * The learnt model cannot be transferred to fit different permutations of the elements of the vector such as $[x_n, x_1, ..., x_2]^T$ \n",
