    "> Opinion: PL papers emphasize the design of syntax and evaluation rules. It should be ensured that the design satisfies the rules and theorems of **progress**, **preservation**, **substitution**, **consistency**, **soundness** and **completeness**. Usually, the synthesis algorithms are plain, intuitive, unsubtle and heuristic if the syntax, the type systems are constructed."
