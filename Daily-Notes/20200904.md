# Paper study [From Program Verification to Program Synthesis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/popl10_synthesis.pdf)

* Given user provided I\O functional specification, a description of the atomic operations (domain constraints), and a specification of the synthesized program's looping structure, allowed stack space, and bound on uage of certain oprations, the synthesized program meets the input-output specification and uses ony the given resources.
* Interpret program synthesis as genralized program verification
* Describe the synthesis problem using a scafoold of the form $<F, D, R>$ where
  * $F$ is a functional specification describing the pre and post condition on the I\O variables
  * $D$ is the domain constraints on expressions and logical guards
  * $R$ indicates resource constraints including
    * `Flowgraph Template` is a string composed by following certain grammer
    * `Stack Template` is a mapping from type to integer specifying the number of extra temporary variables of each type
    * `Computation Template` is a mapping from operation set to integer specifying the upper bound of the number of times an operation is performed
* Alongside the program, the proof terms, i.e. invariants and rankingfunctions, are synthesized. The proof terms will take values from a proof domain that is at least as exprerssive as the expression and guards domains. The proof tools are picked by user.
* A synthesized program is valid if 
  * the program's I\O satisfies the pre and post condition as defined in the $F$ specification
  * there is a program loop corresponding to each loop annotation in the flowgraph template (the flowgraph template has specified the top-level abstract structure of the program and the program should follow)
  * the program statements follows IML to constitute the acyclic fragment
  * the number of local variables is limited by the stack template
  * the number of elementary operations is limited by the computation template
* To synthesis the program, the synthesis conditions are generated as constraints over unknowns for statements, guards, loop invariants and ranking functions. Those constraints resemble verification conditions. Then verification tools can be employed to solve them
* Construct synthesis conditions
 * Represent acyclic code as transition system where the transition is a mapping from the input variables to the output variables. Write down the relation between the pre and post condition as well as the I\O variables and expressions. Translate it into predicate
 * The generated synthesis conditiosn differentiate from verification conditions
  * Verification conditions requires everything known except for the invariants, and sometimes even some invariants should be known
  * In synthesis conditions, all can be unknowns
  * Verification conditions can be solved via verification tools to yield the invariant
  * If a program is correct, the verification conditions are valid; likewise, if a program exists for a scaffold, then its synthesis condition has a satisfying solution
 * Synthesize the code fragments for acyclic fragment and loop annotation in the flowgraph template by expanding the flowgraph in a transitiion system language TSL
 * Collect safety constraints for partial correcness implied by the simple path in the expansion
  * Simple path starts at a loop header and ends at a loop hheader or program exist
  * Loop headers, program entry and exit are annotated with invariants, precondition and postcondition respectively
  * Formulate Hoare triple for each single acyclic fragment and loop
 * Formulate well-formedness conditions for the acyclic statements
  * Constrain that one and only one equality assignment to each variable in each branch
  * Constrain the combination of the guards to be a tautology so that all the guards together cover all the conditions; but not constrain the exclusiveness for each guard
  * Enumerate the guards, assert that the new guard is not entirely subsumed by the union of the previously enumerated guards. Enumeration ends when the union of the enumearted guards holds true.
  * The well-formedness condition of a whole expansion is the intersection of the well-formedness conditions of each branch
 * Encode progress constraint to ensure that the synthesized program terminates
  * Assert the existence of a ranking function as an unknown expression that is lower bounded and decreases with each iteration of the loop
  * Introduce a tracking variable equal to the unknown expression. Assigne the value at the head of the loop. Check whether the expression still equal this tracking variable to see if the expression has decreased after one loop
* To solve synthesis conditions, the scaffold is expanded to expression, use solver to generate a solution to the unknowns, then generate the concrete program with a postprocessor.
 * The postprocessor defines a concretization for each statement in the transition language TST and annotate each loop with its loop invariant and ranking function
 * Use temporary variables to simulate parallel assignment
