# Paper study [From Program Verification to Program Synthesis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/popl10_synthesis.pdf)

* Given user provided I\O functional specification, a description of the atomic operations (domain constraints), and a specification of the synthesized program's looping structure, allowed stack space, and bound on uage of certain oprations, the synthesized program meets the input-output specification and uses ony the given resources.
* Interpret program synthesis as genralized program verification
* Describe the synthesis problem using a scafoold of the form $<F, D, R>$ where
  * $F$ is a functional specification describing the pre and post condition on the I\O variables
  * $D$ is the domain constraints on expressions and logical guards
  * $R$ indicates resource constraints including
    * `Flowgraph Template` is a string composed by following certain grammer
    * `Stack Template` is a mapping from type to integer specifying the number of extra temporary variables of each type
    * `Computation Template` is a mapping from operation set to integer specifying the upper bound of the number of times an operation is performed
* Alongside the program, the proof terms, i.e. invariants and rankingfunctions, are synthesized. The proof terms will take values from a proof domain that is at least as exprerssive as the expression and guards domains. The proof tools are picked by user.
* A synthesized program is valid if 
  * the program's I\O satisfies the pre and post condition as defined in the $F$ specification
  * there is a program loop corresponding to each loop annotation in the flowgraph template (the flowgraph template has specified the top-level abstract structure of the program and the program should follow)
  * the program statements follows IML to constitute the acyclic fragment
  * the number of local variables is limited by the stack template
  * the number of elementary operations is limited by the computation template
* To synthesis the program, the synthesis conditions are generated as constraints over unknowns for statements, guards, loop invariants and ranking functions. Those constraints resemble verification conditions. Then verification tools can be employed to solve them
