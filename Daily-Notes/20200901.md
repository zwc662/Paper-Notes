## 1. Study paper [Program Synthesis from Polymorphic Refinement Types](http://people.csail.mit.edu/polikarn/publications/pldi16.pdf)
* THe paper advocates to write specifications in the form of polymorphic refinement type 
  * Offer combination of expressive power and decidability; enable automatic verification and synthesis of nontrivial program
  * Can be decomposed into independent specifications, reducing the combinations to be considered
* Program synthesis with coarse-grained types alone needs supplement information other than specifications, such as I/O examples, assume/guarantees.
* The outcome is that the verification procedure for the synthesized programs hardly benefits from type checking, because the programs are coarse-grained typed.
* `Refinement types` are types decorated with decidable logic predicates. The type system can instantiate variables of refinement types rather than rigorous specific type
* `Liquid type inference` uses a combination of Hindley-Milner unification and least-fixpoint Horn clause solver to discover refined instantiations for polymorphic types; then it reduce verification to proving the SAT over simple refinement predicates via SMT
  * Liquid type inference cannot be applied to the context of synthesis
  * Liquid type inference requires types of the leaves to be given before hand, constructs types from subterm types; 
* Synthesis accepts unknown types; the top-level type is given; the goal is to construct the program by levaraging the specification
  * To synthesize a program with unspecified structures, a challenge is to find an **over-approximate decomposition**, that is to construct function and argument requirements that are
    * (over-): necessary but not sufficient for the correctness of the output 
    * (-approximate): **strong enough to rule out many incorrect subterms** 
* `Local liquid type checking` is a type checking mechanism 
  * Inspired by bidirectional type checking for bidirectional systems which interleave top-down and bottom-up propagation of type information depending on the syntactic structure of the program
  * This work extends the bottom-up phase with top-down propagation of over-approximate type information => becomes round-trip type checking mechanism
  * Top-down propagation requires finding the greatest fixpoint solution to unkown refinements
  * Fixpoint computation is implemented via enumerating minimal unSAT subsets
    * (Review) A set $S$ is a fixed point of $f$ if $f(S)=S$. A lease fixed point is contained in any other fixed point. A greatest fixed point contains all other fixed points.  
  * A synthesis problem is defined by (1) a goal refinement typoe $T$, (2) a typing environment $\Gamma$ and (3) a set of logical qualifiers $Q$.
    * The environment contains type signatures of compoennts such as constructors, library functions and local variables
    * The qualifiers are predicates 
  * The synthesizer constructs a candidate solution either by picking a component in the environment or decomposing the problem into subproblems
    * When combining the solutions to the subproblems, the combination may not have the desired type
    * The system generates a subtypiong constraint. If the constraint is UNSAT by current combination, the system backtracks to pick a different combination.
    * If the goals of the subproblems are strong, the need to backtrack is reducedd
